Batch_Run.m generates predefined number (100) of MC simulations. For each run, the data is saved as MAT file named with an ID corresponds to the run. To analyze the results, the saved data need to be processed as per requirements.

## Disclaimer

This repository contains code corresponding to a research work completed five years ago. While efforts have been made to document and organize the code for clarity, please note that I may not be readily available to provide detailed explanations or support regarding its implementation. 

Users are encouraged to review the codebase, documentation, and any associated publications for insights into its functionality. 

Thank you for your understanding.
